# 🎅 🎄

Felt bored with just C#, so tried to do them also in Rust, but then it's too much and for most exercises C# is faster so some days will be done in C#, others in Rust, others in both.

# How to run Rust days

Go inside the `rs` directory, then run with:

```
cargo run -- <testname>
```

Where `<testname>` is `1a`, `1b`, `2a`, `2b`... `25a`, `25b`.

For example to run the second test of December 19th:

```
cargo run -- 19b
```


# How to run C# days

Go inside the `cs` directory, then run with:

```
dotnet run -- <testname>
```

Where `<testname>` is `1a`, `1b`, `2a`, `2b`... `25a`, `25b`.

For example to run the second test of December 19th:

```
dotnet run -- 19b
```
